How do I see git added files?😊
display the full list of what's staged at this point. (doc for diff --staged)
git diff --staged --name-only👍

..."un-add" (unstage) one file
git reset -- path/to/file

...or similarly, unstage a directory with everything in it
git reset -- path/to/dir/

...unstage everything (example in the doc)
git reset
